> **A complete, production-ready Flutter healthcare application demonstrating advanced architecture patterns, comprehensive testing strategies, and the power of the `lean_requester` package with `cg_core_defs` abstraction layer.**

## 🏗️ Architecture Excellence

This project showcases a sophisticated **Clean Architecture** implementation with advanced Flutter patterns:

### 🚀 **lean_requester Integration**
Built around the custom **[lean_requester](https://github.com/Jewelch/lean_requester)** package - a lightweight HTTP requester with lean footprint designed for Flutter experts. This package revolutionizes API consumption by:

- **Eliminating Repository Pattern Boilerplate**: Direct DataSource-to-Entity mapping
- **Built-in Caching & Offline Support**: Automatic data persistence with any `CacheManager` 
- **Connectivity Monitoring**: Real-time network awareness with `ConnectivityMonitor`
- **Strategy Pattern Implementation**: Liskov substitution principle for maximum flexibility
- **Advanced Exception Handling**: Smart categorization and automatic failure mapping
- **Authentication Strategies**: Pluggable auth with token refresh capabilities
- **Request Interceptors**: Complete request/response/error pipeline

### 🔧 **cg_core_defs Abstraction Layer**
Leverages the **[cg_core_defs](https://github.com/Jewelch/cg_core_defs)** package which provides essential abstract interfaces:

- **`ConnectivityMonitor`**: Abstract connectivity monitoring with real-time status
- **`CacheManager<T>`**: Generic cache interface with type safety  
- **`Observable<T>`**: Reactive programming patterns
- **`Either<L, R>`**: Functional error handling
- **`DIContainer`**: Dependency injection with multiple strategies

### 📦 **Author's Package Ecosystem**
> **Note**: Both `lean_requester` and `cg_core_defs` are **entirely designed and developed by Jewel Cheriaa**, demonstrating expertise in creating production-ready Flutter packages.

**Cross-Platform Package Portfolio:**
- 🐦 **Flutter**: [`lean_requester`](https://github.com/Jewelch/lean_requester) + [`cg_core_defs`](https://github.com/Jewelch/cg_core_defs)
- 🍎 **iOS Swift**: [`swiftui_consumer`](https://github.com/Jewelch/swiftui_consumer) + [`swiftui_infrastructure`](https://github.com/Jewelch/swiftui_infrastructure)
- 📊 **Swift Package Manager**: `swift-tools-version: 6.0` compatible

### 🏛️ **Clean Architecture Layers**

```
📱 Presentation (BLoC + Widgets)
    ↓
🔄 Business Logic (Use Cases + Entities) 
    ↓
📊 Data (lean_requester + Models)
    ↓
🌐 External (API + Cache + Network)
```

- **Presentation Layer**: Smart BLoC with lifecycle management + Class-based widgets
- **Domain Layer**: Use Cases with Either pattern + Immutable entities with Equatable
- **Data Layer**: lean_requester DataSources + DAO/DTO pattern models
- **External Layer**: cg_core_defs abstractions for cache, connectivity, and DI

## 🧪 Testing Excellence - 100% Coverage

### 📊 **Complete Test Coverage**
- **✅ 100% Line Coverage** ([View Detailed Report](coverage/html/index.html))
- **✅ 93 Unit Tests** - All layers thoroughly tested
- **✅ Healthcare-Grade Quality** - Production-ready reliability

### 📈 **Coverage Breakdown**
| Layer | Coverage | Tests |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Data Models (DAO)** | 100% | JSON serialization, null handling |
| **Domain Entities (DTO)** | 100% | copyWith(), Equatable, factory methods |
| **Use Cases** | 100% | Either pattern, model transformations |
| **Helpers & Utilities** | 100% | Edge cases, error scenarios |

### 🤖 **Robot Pattern Integration Tests**
Advanced integration testing using the **Robot Pattern** with modular architecture:

```
integration_test/features/shift_handover/
├── main/e2e_shift_handover_test.dart     # 🎭 Test orchestration
├── parts/step_*.dart                     # 📝 Modular test steps  
├── robots/shift_handover_*_robot.dart    # 🤖 Specialized robots
└── README.md                             # 📚 Complete documentation
```

**Advanced Testing Features:**
- **✅ Modular Step Files**: Human-readable test workflow
- **✅ Specialized Robots**: Actions vs Assertions separation
- **✅ Dynamic Mock Data**: Environment-controlled (1 note in test, 5 in production)
- **✅ Key-Based Targeting**: `visibleForTesting` keys for precise widget interaction
- **✅ Safe Lifecycle Management**: Robust `TextEditingController` handling
- **✅ Real User Simulation**: Keyboard actions, dropdown interactions, ListView scrolling

## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements
